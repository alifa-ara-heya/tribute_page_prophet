            <ul>
                <h4>Early Meccan Period</h4>
                <li>
                    <div class="bold">570 AD</div>(52 years Before Hijrah or Migration to Medina) Muhammad Ibn Abd Allah
                    (Peace be upon him) born in the city of Mecca (a city in the Hejaz, lit. literally “the barrier”, a
                    region in the west of present-day Saudi Arabia), in the Year of the Elephant.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <div class="bold">578 AD</div>Shaybah ibn Hashim (born c. 497), better known as Abd al-Muttalib, the
                    grandfather of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), dies. Muhammad (ﷺ) was eight years old.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <div class="bold">583 AD</div>Muhammad (ﷺ), age 12, accompanied his uncle Abu Talib during trading
                    journeys to Syria. In one of them, his prophetic status was discovered by Bahira, a Christian monk
                    of Busra al-Sham (southern Syria), who, after taking one look at Muhammad, pulled off his shirt to
                    reveal the “seal of prophecy” (khatam an-nubuwwah) between Muhammad's shoulder blades that the monk
                    recognized from ancient manuscripts.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <div class="bold">591 AD</div>Muhammad (ﷺ) joined a pact of chivalry (futuwwah) for the
                    establishment of justice and the protection of the weak and the oppressed made by certain notables
                    of the Quraysh like Abd Allah ibn Judan, the chief of the clan of Taym and cousin of Abu Bakr
                    al-Siddiq. Az-Zubayr ibn Abd al-Muttalib, chief of the Hashim Clan brought the young Muhammad that
                    took part of the pact. The oath was called Hilf al-Fudul (League of the Virtuous).Muhammad (ﷺ) was
                    chosen because of his absolute truthfulness, trustworthiness and integrity, his sense of justice and
                    compassion for the poor, oppressed and downtrodden. Al-Amin, the Trustworthy, the Honest, al-Sadiq,
                    the Truthful, were the titles on everybody's lips for Muhammad (ﷺ), which means itself the Praised
                    One.

                <li>
                    <div class="bold">594 AD</div>Khadija bint Khuwaylid (born c. 555) was daughter of a caravan
                    merchant, Khuwaylid ibn Asad (died c. 585) and member of the tribe of Quraysh. She was a widow with
                    considerable wealth. Khadija did not travel with her trade caravans; she employed others to trade on
                    her behalf for a commission. By this time Khadija needed an agent for a transaction in Syria. Abu
                    Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib recommended her cousin Muhammad ibn Abd Allah. Khadija was so pleased with
                    the young man’s honesty and success on this trip to Syria that she married him when she was aged 40
                    and he aged 25. Many wealthy Quraysh men had already asked for her hand in marriage, but all had
                    been refused.

                <h4>Period of the Meccan revelations</h4>

                <li>
                    <div class="bold">610 AD</div>Muhammad (ﷺ) struggled to make sense of humanity’s relationships with
                    God and with one other. He found the paganism with which he had been brought up inadequate, and he
                    was disturbed by the selfishness and immorality he saw in his own town of Mecca. Muhammad
                    (ﷺ)struggled to make sense of humanity's relationships with God and with one other. He found the
                    paganism with which he had been brought up inadequate, and he was disturbed by the selfishness and
                    immorality he saw in his own town of Mecca.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <div class="bold">619 AD </div>The Year of Sorrow (Am al-Huzn). Prophet Muhammad in this very same
                    year, had to face the death of his beloved wife, Khadijah (Radi Allahu anha- May Allah be pleased
                    with her) and his dear uncle, Abu Talib.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <div class="bold">620 AD</div>Night Journey and Ascension (Al-Isra wal-Mi'raj). The night journey
                    (al-isra) was that made by the Prophet Muhammad thought the air, mounted on al-Buraq, in the company
                    of Archangel Jibril, from Masjid al-Haram at Mecca to the Farthest Mosque or Masjid al-Aqsa at
                    Jerusalem; thence he made the Ascension (al-Mi'raj) through the Seven Heavens, borne by Jibril and
                    entered Allah's presence.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <div class="bold">621 AD</div>The First Treaty of Aqabah (a place between Mina and Mecca). Members
                    of the al-Aws and al-Khazraj tribes of Yathrib (Medina), who were Yemenite migrants (Arab Qahtani),
                    converted to Islam and negotiated with Muhammad with the aim of making him leader of their
                    strife-ridden tribal community.
